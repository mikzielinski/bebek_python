09.10.2022 - Fixed problem with missing pictures of chars
I have to later mantain it in better way then now, I added dictionary of Button and Picture so now python garbage collector wont delete it :D
it is working well. Also when character is moving it's poping and saving pic in dict not based on btn.image property.
